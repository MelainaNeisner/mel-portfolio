                    <h3>About</h3>
                    <p>After graduating from Univeristy of Massachusetts Boston with a BA in Political Science I wound up
                        perusing a career as a CrossFit Coach. Over the last 5 years I've had the pleasure of being 
                        mentored by some of the greats of the CrossFit world and got to know many incredible
                        communities.  
                    </p>
                    <p>In between learning, coaching, and improving my own CrossFit skills, I decided to give my 
                        gyms website a face lift. I enjoyed designing the website and the challenge of implenting the design, 
                        as well as adding fun features with JavaScript. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        When I am not coaching, CrossFitting, or coding you can find me spending my time outside
                        in any active capacity or trying to find a new sweets recipe to bake. 
                    </p>
                    <p>I am thrilled to begin the Thinkful Software Engineering Immersion program and am excited
                        to begin working with other developers. If you have any questions or would like to reach out 
                        feel free to <a href="mailto:mmneisner@gmail.com?subject=Work%20Request">email me!</a>
